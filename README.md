## **Algorithm for Low-Cost 3D Scanner System**

### **1. Problem Statement**
To design and implement a low-cost 3D scanner system capable of accurately reconstructing a 3D object’s surface using minimal components, including ToF sensors, stepper motors, servo motors, and a microcontroller. The scanner outputs a 3D mesh that can be visualized and exported as an STL file.

---

### **2. Algorithm**

#### **Step 1: Initialization**
1. **Component Setup**:
   - Initialize **Arduino Nano** to interface with:
     - ToF sensors using I2C communication.
     - Stepper motors and servo motors via motor drivers.
   - Configure hardware connections:
     - Mount the horizontal ToF sensor (Sensor 1) to capture radial data.
     - Mount the vertical ToF sensor (Sensor 2) on a servo for height data collection.

2. **Calibration**:
   - Calibrate the sensors for accurate distance measurements:
     - Place objects at known distances to verify sensor accuracy.
   - Set stepper motor step size (e.g., 1°) for platform rotation.

3. **Define Global Parameters**:
   - **Angular Resolution** (\( \Delta \theta \)): Incremental rotation of the platform.
   - **Vertical Resolution** (\( \Delta h \)): Incremental height adjustment of the vertical scanning arm.
   - Maximum dimensions of the object to scan (e.g., height and radius).

---

#### **Step 2: Scanning Process**
1. **Start Horizontal Scanning**:
   - Place the object on the rotating platform.
   - For each rotation angle **\( \theta \)** from 0° to 360° with step size \( \Delta \theta \):
     - Rotate the platform by \( \Delta \theta \) using a stepper motor.
     - Measure radial distance **\( r \)** from Sensor 1.
     - Calculate the Cartesian coordinates:
       \[
       x = r \cdot \cos(\theta), \quad y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)
       \]
     - Record the data point as \((x, y, z)\), where \( z \) is the current height.

2. **Adjust Vertical Position**:
   - Move Sensor 2 vertically using a servo motor in increments of \( \Delta h \).
   - Repeat horizontal scanning for each height level until the object’s full height is scanned.

3. **Store Data**:
   - Append all captured points to a structured file format (e.g., CSV or TXT).

---

#### **Step 3: Point Cloud Generation**
1. **Load Collected Data**:
   - Import the \((x, y, z)\) points into a point cloud processing library or software.
2. **Filter Noise**:
   - Apply statistical outlier filtering to remove inaccurate points.
3. **Normalize Data**:
   - Align all points relative to the platform’s origin.
4. **Save Point Cloud**:
   - Save the cleaned and normalized point cloud as `points.csv`.

---

#### **Step 4: Mesh Reconstruction**
1. **Load Point Cloud**:
   - Import the point cloud into a reconstruction algorithm (e.g., Poisson Surface Reconstruction or Delaunay Triangulation).
2. **Reconstruct Surface**:
   - Generate a triangular mesh that connects the points:
     - For Poisson Reconstruction:
       - Estimate the surface normals.
       - Fit an implicit function to the points to create a smooth surface.
3. **Clean the Mesh**:
   - Crop unnecessary parts (e.g., base of the object).
   - Remove duplicate vertices or fill small holes.
4. **Save Mesh**:
   - Export the reconstructed mesh as an STL file.

---

#### **Step 5: Visualization and Export**
1. **Visualize 3D Model**:
   - Use visualization tools (e.g., Open3D, Meshlab) to render the mesh.
2. **Interactive Features**:
   - Allow users to inspect the model (rotate, zoom).
   - Provide an option to export the mesh as STL for 3D printing or OBJ for AR applications.
3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add dynamic calibration to adjust sensor offsets.
   - Implement real-time visualization during scanning.

### **3. Pseudocode Representation**

#### Initialization:
```pseudo
Initialize ToF sensors with I2C communication.
Setup stepper motors, servo motors, and drivers.
Define parameters: angular_resolution (Δθ), height_resolution (Δh), max_height.
Calibrate ToF sensors for accurate distance measurements.
```

#### Scanning:
```pseudo
for height = 0 to max_height step Δh:
    for angle = 0 to 360 step Δθ:
        Rotate platform by Δθ.
        Measure distance r from Sensor 1.
        Compute x = r * cos(angle), y = r * sin(angle).
        Record point (x, y, height).
    Adjust Sensor 2 position by Δh.
```

#### Point Cloud Processing:
```pseudo
Load collected points from "points.csv".
Apply noise filtering to remove outliers.
Normalize and align points relative to the platform’s origin.
Save cleaned point cloud as "processed_points.csv".
```

#### Mesh Reconstruction:
```pseudo
Load "processed_points.csv" into reconstruction software.
Apply Poisson Surface Reconstruction:
    Estimate surface normals.
    Generate a smooth triangular mesh.
Clean the mesh:
    Remove duplicate vertices.
    Crop unnecessary parts.
Save the final mesh as "output_mesh.stl".
```

#### Visualization:
```pseudo
Load "output_mesh.stl" into visualization software.
Enable interactive features: rotation, zoom, STL export.
```

### **4. Challenges and Mitigation**
- **Sensor Noise**:
  - Solution: Use statistical filtering to clean the point cloud.
- **Sparse Data**:
  - Solution: Reduce angular and height step sizes for higher resolution.
- **Alignment Errors**:

1. **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes accessible components like ToF sensors and Arduino Nano.
2. **Customizable**: Parameters such as resolution and scanning area can be adjusted.
3. **Extensible**: Features like dynamic calibration or AR integration can be added.

### **6. Output**
1. Point Cloud: A dense collection of \((x, y, z)\) points representing the object’s surface.
2. 3D Mesh: A smooth triangular mesh saved as an STL file for 3D printing or visualization.
