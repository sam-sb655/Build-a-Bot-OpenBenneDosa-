Here's the **reconstructed algorithm and pseudocode** tailored to your setup, using **two stepper motors**, one for rotating the platform and the other for positioning the ToF sensors (horizontal and vertical adjustments via gears).

## **Revised Algorithm for Low-Cost 3D Scanner**

### **1. Problem Statement**
To design a low-cost 3D scanner using a platform rotating stepper motor and a gear-driven stepper motor that positions interconnected horizontal and vertical ToF sensors. The goal is to capture a 3D representation of an object, reconstruct it into a mesh, and export it as an STL file.

---

### **2. Revised Algorithm**

#### **Step 1: Initialization**
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - **Stepper Motor 1**: Rotate the platform for 360° scanning.
   - **Stepper Motor 2**: Drive the horizontal and vertical ToF sensors via gears.
   - Mount the horizontal ToF sensor (Sensor 1) to scan radial distances.
   - Mount the vertical ToF sensor (Sensor 2) to scan height profiles.

2. **Calibration**:
   - Test and calibrate the stepper motors for accurate angular and linear movement.
   - Align the gears to ensure smooth movement of the ToF sensors.

3. **Define Parameters**:
   - Angular resolution (\( \Delta \theta \)): Stepper Motor 1 increments for platform rotation.
   - Linear resolution (\( \Delta h \)): Stepper Motor 2 increments for ToF sensor movement.

---

#### **Step 2: Scanning Process**
1. **Object Placement**:
   - Place the object on the rotating platform.

2. **Horizontal Scanning**:
   - For each rotation angle (\( \theta \)) of the platform:
     1. Rotate Stepper Motor 1 by \( \Delta \theta \) degrees.
     2. Record radial distance \( r \) from Sensor 1.
     3. Compute coordinates:
        \[
        x = r \cdot \cos(\theta), \quad y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)
        \]

3. **Vertical Scanning**:
   - Use Stepper Motor 2 to move Sensor 2 vertically via the gear system.
   - For each height increment (\( h \)) from \( 0 \) to \( \text{max\_height} \):
     1. Measure height \( z \) using Sensor 2.
     2. Adjust Sensor 1’s horizontal position for accurate coverage.

4. **Store Data**:
   - Append all scanned points as \((x, y, z)\) to a file.

---

#### **Step 3: Point Cloud Processing**
1. **Filter Data**:
   - Remove noise and outliers using a statistical filter.
2. **Normalize Coordinates**:
   - Transform all points relative to the platform’s origin.
3. **Save Processed Points**:
   - Save the cleaned data as `points.csv`.

---

#### **Step 4: Mesh Reconstruction**
1. **Reconstruct Surface**:
   - Load the point cloud into Poisson Surface Reconstruction or Alpha Shapes.
   - Generate a smooth triangular mesh.
2. **Clean the Mesh**:
   - Remove artifacts, fill small holes, and crop unnecessary parts.
3. **Save Mesh**:
   - Export the reconstructed mesh as `model.stl`.

---

#### **Step 5: Visualization and Export**
1. **Visualize**:
   - Render the 3D model in a visualization tool (e.g., Open3D or Meshlab).
2. **Export**:
   - Provide STL or OBJ file options for 3D printing or further use.

---

### **3. Revised Pseudocode**

#### **Initialization**:
```pseudo
Initialize Stepper Motor 1 for platform rotation.
Initialize Stepper Motor 2 for vertical and horizontal ToF movement via gears.
Calibrate ToF sensors for accurate distance measurements.
Define:
    angular_resolution (Δθ): Step size for platform rotation.
    height_resolution (Δh): Step size for vertical movement.
    max_height: Maximum height to scan.
```

#### **Scanning**:
```pseudo
for angle θ from 0 to 360 step Δθ:
    Rotate platform using Stepper Motor 1 by Δθ.
    Measure radial distance r from Sensor 1.
    Compute:
        x = r * cos(θ)
        y = r * sin(θ)

    for height h from 0 to max_height step Δh:
        Move Sensor 2 vertically using Stepper Motor 2.
        Measure height z using Sensor 2.
        Record point (x, y, z).
```

#### **Point Cloud Processing**:
```pseudo
Load all collected points from "points.csv".
Apply noise filtering to remove outliers.
Normalize and align all points to the platform’s origin.
Save the processed point cloud as "processed_points.csv".
```

#### **Mesh Reconstruction**:
```pseudo
Load "processed_points.csv" into reconstruction software.
Apply Poisson Surface Reconstruction:
    Estimate normals and fit a smooth surface.
Clean the reconstructed mesh:
    Crop unnecessary parts, fill holes, and remove duplicates.
Save the final mesh as "model.stl".
```

#### **Visualization**:
```pseudo
Load "model.stl" into visualization software.
Provide rotation, zoom, and STL export options.
```

### **4. Key Adjustments for Gears and Limited Motors**
1. **Interconnected Gears**:
   - Ensure the stepper motor driving Sensor 2 adjusts both vertical and horizontal positions as needed.
   - Use precise gear ratios to ensure controlled movement.
2. **Sensor Timing**:
   - Synchronize Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 measurements with motor movements to avoid data loss.
3. **Minimalist Design**:
   - Optimize the gear mechanism to reduce complexity and weight.

---

### **5. Challenges and Mitigation**
- **Gear Alignment**:
  - Solution: Test gear movement thoroughly and ensure no slippage during operation.
- **Sensor Synchronization**:
  - Solution: Introduce delays in the Arduino code to allow sufficient time for measurements.
- **Limited Motors**:
  - Solution: Efficiently plan scanning paths to minimize redundant movements.
